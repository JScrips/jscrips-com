            <p class ='mainbodymeat'>I'm coming to realize that virtually everything on the web is created, powered, and altered through Javacript, CSS, and HTML. Learning these languages has proven to be an invaluable skill! My only regret was not learning them sooner!</p>

          <h3>HTML</h3>
            <p class= 'boxtext'>I've recently started learning about HTML5. Everyday, I'm learning more and more about the different capabilities of this language. I plan on mastering the language and implimenting everything I learned into my future endeavors. </p>

          <h3>CSS</h3>
            <p class = 'boxtext'> CSS is a real beast. Coming in not knowing anything has been a real challenge for me; however, like with with anything, practice makes perfect. I've learned different aspects of CSS as well as a bit of flexbox and continue to learn each day! </p>
            </div> <!-- CSS box end-->
            <div class = 'column'> <!-- And More box start-->
          <h3>And Javascript!</h3>  
            <p class ='boxtext'>Last but not least, I've learned so much about Javascript. Oddly enough, I can say that I do not hate Javascript after all of the hours of studying. It's actually really empowering to see what I'm able to do with this powerful language. I look forward to my evolution. </p>
